# MultiChainWalletBrute

## Overview
MultiChainWalletBrute is a powerful and efficient tool designed to brute force multiple wallet mnemonics. This multi-threaded application can automatically generate seed phrases and check balances across various blockchain networks. When a wallet with a non-zero balance is discovered, the tool logs the wallet's details (address, mnemonic, private key, and balances) and saves them to a file named `result.txt`.
